    //which two are benefits of polymorphism?(choose two)
    /*
    A. Faster code at runtime  			>> Slower, because it must check memory
    B. More efficient code at runtime	>> if it is slower, it is not efficient
    C. More dynamic code at runtime   	>> OK : actual types of object are determined dynamically at runtime
    D. More flexible and reusable code	>> OK : casting 
    E. Code that is protected from extension by other classes  >> Encapsulation
    Answer: C D
    
    
   For D:  through casting, different subclass objects can be passed a method which gets superclass object
   Container classes are those classes representing collections of objects, usually of the same or RELATED TYPES.
    for example Q091: Tiger>Cat>Animal
    ArrayList<Animal> myList=new ArrayList<>();
		myList.add(new Tiger());
