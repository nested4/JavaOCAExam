/**
Here are some basic rules to keep in mind when casting variables:
1. Casting an object from a subclass to a superclass doesnâ€™t require an explicit cast.
2. Casting an object from a superclass to a subclass requires an explicit cast.
3. The compiler will not allow casts to unrelated types.
4. Even when the code compiles without issue, an exception may be thrown at runtime 
	if the object being cast is not actually an instance of that class.

C2  to C1 >> OK
What is the result in this case:
C2 obj3 = new C1();
