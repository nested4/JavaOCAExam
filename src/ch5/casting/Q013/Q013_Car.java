 Order of initialization
1-If there is a superclass, initialize it first
2-Static variable declarations and static initializers in the order they appear in the file.
3-Instance variable declarations and instance initializers in the order they appear in the file.
4-The constructor.

Further information for the last operation-Casting: 
 FIGURE 5.6 Object vs. reference, p.280,281
 Conceptually, though, you should consider the object as the entity that exists in memory, allocated by the JRE. 
 	Regardless of the type of the reference you have for the object in memory, the object itself doesnâ€™t change
 
 We can summarize this principle with the following two rules:
1. The type of the object determines which properties exist within the object in memory.
2. The type of the reference to the object determines which methods and variables are accessible to the Java program.
