/***** NOTES
 Explanation:
Java bytecodes help make "write once, run anywhere" possible. 
You can compile your program into bytecodes on any platform that has a Java compiler. 
The bytecodes can then be run on any implementation of the Java VM. 
That means that as long as a computer has a Java VM, 
	the same program written in the Java programming language can run on 
	Windows, a Solaris workstation, or on an iMac.
