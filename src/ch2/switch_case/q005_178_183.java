/***NOTES
FIGURE 2.4 The structure of a switch statement, p.73
break: optional, with and without break cause different results, p.74
default: optional
expression in switch: single value, p.72
	A switch statement, as shown in Figure 2.4, is a complex decision-making 
	structure in which a single value is evaluated 
Compile-time Constant Values, p.73
	The values in each case statement must be compile-time constant values 
	of the same data type as the switch value
